The object of the game is to catch fish.
Once a fish has been hooked (left mouse button), the player must use his/her boat to stay close to the fish as it moves.
Staying too far from the fish will let it get away as your line has limited tension.

Run this by doing "mongod" in the command line (database setup)
and running "node app.js" in another command line.
