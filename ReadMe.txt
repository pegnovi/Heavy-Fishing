The object of the game is to catch fish.
Once a fish has been hooked (left mouse button), the player must use his/her boat to stay close to the fish as it moves.
Drain the fish of its energy by staying close to it (fish energy = blue bar on the left).
Staying too far from the fish will let it get away as your line has limited tension (tension meter = yellow bar on the right).

Run this by doing "mongod" in the command line (database setup)
and running "node app.js" in another command line.
